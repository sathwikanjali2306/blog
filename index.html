    <mark>About Nobi:-</mark>
    <p>Nobita Nobi (野比 のび太のび のびた Nobi Nobita), known simply as Noby (a possible diminutive of his Japanese name) in the American and UK versions, is the main protagonist of the Doraemon franchise. He was a failure of a person until Doraemon came from the 22nd century to aid him so he could have a better future in life.
     Nobita is voiced by Yoshiko Ōta in the 1973 series, Noriko Ohara from 1979-March 2005, and Megumi Ōhara from April 2005 onwards..</p>

    <p align="justify" contenteditable="">RNobita and Doraemon can be called the closest friends of all time. They both have a strong bond and will never leave each other's side. As seen in many episodes, Nobita and Doraemon cannot live apart from each other and are always by each other's side, in times of danger, times of happiness, or times of sadness, despite Doraemon's constant annoyance of Nobita's lazy behavior and habit of pouncing on and/or wrapping his arms around him while whining and crying like a baby. Sometimes when villains pose as Doraemon, only Nobita could properly recognize him.</p>
